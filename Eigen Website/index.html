            <p>
                The Summoner and their Familiar are a team, fighting together to overwhelm their enemies. The Familiar
                rushes into the thick of it, dealing heavy physical damage and holding the attention of their opponent.
                Meanwhile, the Summoner hangs back, supporting their Familiar with long range skills that both help
                their feline friend and hinder their shared enemy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Don’t let the adorable appearance of these two fool you. Summoner attacks deal constant damage and can
                readily control the flow of battle, making them particularly hard to deal with. Even if one part of the
                team is defeated, they can revive their fallen ally and jump right back into the fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Summoner and their Familiar are the strongest at transferring health from foes to themselves. While
                it is a great class for novices, actually mastering the Summoner is a difficult process given their wide
                range of tactics and abilities.

                <h2>Video</h2>
                <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8_N2EhMcDE" frameborder="0"

            <P>Unlike other classes, the Force Master attacks at long range, dealing heavy damage from a safe distance.
                Their swift strikes and ability to remain on the move while attacking makes them a dynamic addition to
                any battle. They are less durable than the other classes, so careful positioning is key to their
                survival.
            </P>

            <P>
                The Force Master is able to freely switch between elements; their searing Fire abilities stack damage
                with repeated attacks, while the freezing Ice powers control the battlefield and enhance their defenses.
                With careful focus they can even snatch an enemy and hold them suspended in the air, leaving that foe
                helpless against incoming attacks.
            </P>

            <P>
                Other classes can’t compete with the Force Master’s ability to handle groups of enemies, but PvP arenas
                prove more challenging than ever. Only a truly skilled Force Master can overcome the direct attention of
                a fellow warrior.

            <h2>Blade Dancer</h2>
            <ASIDE class="rondehoeken">
                <h2>Video</h2>
                <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VcV1VqDWlY" frameborder="0"

            </Aside>
            <p>The Lyn have also taken up the sword, but rather than wholly adopt the techniques of the Blade Master,
                they have invented their own unique blend of skills exclusive to their kind. The Blade Dancer merges
                rapid attack speed, high mobility, and devestating control abilities at the expense of defense.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blade Dancers focus on dashing around the battlefield at blinding speed to evade damage entirely. With
                both physical and mystical abilities at their disposal, they can dominate a fight before their opponent
                even realizes what hit them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Blade Dancer’s high attack speed and ability to chain attacks make them excel at one-on-one battles,
                while their crowd control skills give them an undeniable edge in parties. However, the Blade Dancer must
                always be aware of their Focus and pace themselves lest they risk running out of steam and leave
                themselves open to counter-attack.
